Within the enterprise context, data integration problems arise whenever data from separate sources needs to be combined as the basis for new applications or data analysis projects. Within the context of the Web, data integration techniques form the foundation for taking advantage of the ever growing number of publicly- accessible data sources. The course will cover the following topics:  1.    Heterogeneity and Distributedness 2.    The Data Integration Process 3.    Structured Data on the Web 4.    Data Exchange Formats 5.
