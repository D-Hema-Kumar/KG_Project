The projects will focus on a varietyof IR problems and implementation of IR models theoreticallycovered in the course Information Retrieval and Web Search(IE 663). It is thus highly recommended to attend this coursetogether with the course IE 663. Project deliverables includeboth software (i.e., code and documentation) and a shortreport explaining the work performed and its evaluation. Thestudents are expected to clearly and coherently present theproject results."
